This is my second trial doing the google landing page.

The page was made in a 1280x1024 screen, so it may be shown in a weird way on different screen resolutions.

First commit, Google logo and searchbar pÄºacement.

Second commit, Search and I'm Feeling Lucky buttons.

Third commit, searchbar and buttons style.
